This project is a comprehensive system designed to predict loan approvals and house prices using machine learning techniques. It integrates user authentication, data analysis, predictive modeling, and database management to provide a seamless experience for users seeking loan approvals and house price estimations.

Features
User Authentication: Notebooks like Login.ipynb, NewUserRegistration.ipynb, and Forget_Password.ipynb handle user login, registration, and password recovery processes.
GitHub

Loan Approval Prediction: Home_Loan_Prediction.ipynb utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of loan approvals based on user input and historical data.
GitHub

House Price Prediction: House_Price_Prediction.ipynb estimates house prices using relevant features from the provided dataset.
